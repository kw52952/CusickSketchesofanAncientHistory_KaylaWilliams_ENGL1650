PREFACE.

I have been long waiting in hopes that some of my people, who have received an Eng-
lish education, would have undertaken the work as to give a sketch of the Ancient History
of the Six Nations ; but found no one seemed to concur in the matter, after some hesitation
I determined to commence the work; but found the history involved with fables ; and be-
sides, examining myself, finding so small educated that it was impossible for me to compose the work without much difficulty. After various reasons I abandoned the idea : I however,
took up a resolution to continue the work, which I have taken much pains procuring the
materials, and translating it into English language. I have endeavored to throw some light
on the history of the original population of the country, which I believe never have been
recorded. I hope this little work will be acceptable to the public.
