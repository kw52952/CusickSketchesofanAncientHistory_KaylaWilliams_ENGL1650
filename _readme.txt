I chose to record this metadata, because I think it captures the most essential identifying information to provide context and allow anyone to understand and organize each page of the first 25 pages of the book. The [file_name] and [unique_id] allow each page to be identified and tracked individually of the others. The [page] column indicates the order of the text. The [image_url] column allows someone to easily access any individual page's digital image. The [title], [author], [publisher], and [year_published] columns provides the basic bibliographic context. The [subject] data helps identify the book's content by topic and categorize it under other history materials. The [illustration], [type], and [page_content] columns give context to the visual and textual content of the individual pages and their function within the book. I focused on these 12 categories to provide a comprehensive and practical overview of each file (page) that is helpful for scholars and non-scholars alike, while also keeping it concise and not trying to capture every single detail about the pages. 

I used Tesseract to generate 25 .txt files of the first 25 photographed pages of Cusick's book. The first page is the cover, next two pages are blank, then the preface, then 8 pages of images and captions, and the last of the pages are full text pages. The OCR results varied significantly depending on the type of page. The purely text pages were mostly accurate with a few inconsistencies that required minimal correction, while the image/caption pages containing large landscape images and a caption underneath, produced almost entirely unreadable results. I had to type the captions manually and simply added '[image]' on these .txt files to explain the lack of content. I also had 6 fully blank pages in my sample (the backs of pages) which, rightfully, produced a blank .txt file. This made me realize how dependent OCR accuracy is on formatting and page layout. Materials who academia deems are culturally significant and/or academically valuable tend to receive the more careful hand-transcription and cleaning while lesser-known pieces from more lesser-known authors won't get this kind of care. I think Cusick's book would be one to get more special attention as this is recognized as one of the firsts (if not the first) books on Native American history written by a Native American.
