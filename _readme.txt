I chose to record this metadata, because I think it captures the most essential identifying information to provide context and allow anyone to understand and organize each page of the first 25 pages of the book. The [file_name] and [unique_id] allow each page to be identified and tracked individually of the others. The [page] column indicates the order of the text. The [image_url] column allows someone to easily access any individual page's digital image. The [title], [author], [publisher], and [year_published] columns provides the basic bibliographic context. The [subject] data helps identify the book's content by topic and categorize it under other history materials. The [illustration], [type], and [page_content] columns give context to the visual and textual content of the individual pages and their function within the book. I focused on these 12 categories to provide a comprehensive and practical overview of each file (page) that is helpful for scholars and non-scholars alike, while also keeping it concise and not trying to capture every single detail about the pages.
